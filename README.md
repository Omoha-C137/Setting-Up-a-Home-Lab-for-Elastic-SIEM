<H1>Setting Up a Home Lab for Elastic SIEM: A Step-by-Step Guide</H1>
In this comprehensive guide, I walked myself through the process of 
creating my own Elastic Stack Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) home lab using 
the Elastic Web portal and a Kali Linux virtual machine (VM).
By the end of this project, I was able to generate and analyze security events, 
set up agents for log forwarding, create dashboards, and establish security alerts.

<h2>Step 1: Set up a free trial Elastic Account</h2>
-Create a free Elastic account.
-Log in to the Elastic Cloud console.
-Start a free trial, create an Elasticsearch deployment, and choose your region and deployment size.
-Install and enable Elastic prebuilt rules

<h2>Step 2: Setting up the Linux VM</h2>
Download the Kali Linux VM from the official website.
Set up a new VM with the Kali VM file using your preferred virtualization platform (e.g., VirtualBox or VMware). 
If you’re stuck on how to do this, read the Kali Linux documentation and look on Google or YouTube.
Complete the Kali Linux installation and log in with both the default username and default password as kali

<H2>Step 3: Setting up the Agent to Collect Logs</H2>
-Learn about the role of agents in Elastic SIEM.


<H2>Step 4: Generating Security Events on the Kali VM using Nmap</H2>
-Install Nmap on the Linux VM (if not using Kali).
-Run some Nmap scans on your Kali VM’s IP address to generate security events in Elastic.

<H2>Step 5: Querying for Security Events in the Elastic SIEM</H2>
-Learn how to query and analyze logs in Elastic SIEM.
-Search for specific security events using Elastic’s web interface.

Analyzing diverse security events in Elastic SIEM provides
valuable insights into real-world security incident detection,
investigation, and response procedures. Try opening different 
applications or create other events on your Kali VM and see if you can spot them in Elastic.
Doing this will reinforce your understanding of Kali,
Linux terminal commands, and how to better spot true positive and false positive security events in your SIEM.

<H2>Step 6: Create a Dashboard to Visualize the Events</H2>
Explore how to use visualizations and dashboards to analyze event logs.

<h2>Step 7: Create an Alert</h2>
-Create an alert in Elastic SIEM to detect Nmap scans based on custom queries.
Alerts serve as a vital component in a SIEM system, 
ensuring the prompt detection and response to security incidents. 
These alerts are crafted based on predefined rules or customized queries, 
tailored to trigger precise actions when specific conditions are met.
The focus here is to walk you through the process of setting up an alert
within Elastic SIEM, designed to detect specified events (in this case, Nmap scans).
By adhering to these steps, you’ll establish an alert system that actively monitors 
your logs for predefined activities that promptly informs you upon their detection


<h2>Conclusion</h2>
In this guide, I set up a home lab to practice Elastic SIEM and gained hands-on experience in security monitoring and incident response. 
I learned how to forward data, generate and analyze security events, create dashboards, and set up alerts.
This practical experience enhanced my skills and prepared me for a career as a security analyst or engineer.
